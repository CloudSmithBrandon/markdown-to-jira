# GCP AEC Reports

- GCP IAM Report Development @samantha.wabi {AEC}
  This is an overarching ticket that encompasses requirements for building the GCP IAM Report for AEC
  - Create GCP organizations table {AEC} {Data} +3
  - Create GCP projects table {AEC} {Data} +3
  - Create GCP Service Accounts table {AEC} {Data} +9
    A service account is a special Google account that belongs to an application or a VM, instead of to an individual end-user. The application uses the service account to call the service's Google API so that users aren't directly involved.  
  - Create GCP Service Account Policy table {AEC} {Data} +6
    Service accounts represent service-level security of the Resources (application or a VM) which can be determined by the roles assigned to it. Enrolling ServiceAccount with Admin rights gives full access to an assigned application or a VM. A ServiceAccount Access holder can perform critical actions like delete, update change settings, etc. without user intervention. For this reason, it's recommended that service accounts not have Admin rights.
  - Create GCP Virtual Machines table {AEC} {Data} +6
    It is recommended to use Instance specific SSH key(s) instead of using common/shared project-wide SSH key(s) to access Instances.

    Enabling OS login binds SSH certificates to IAM users and facilitates effective SSH certificate management.
  - Create GCP Virtual Machine Service Accounts table {AEC} {Data} +8
    The default Compute Engine service account has the Editor role on the project, which allows read and write access to most Google Cloud Services. To defend against privilege escalations if your VM is compromised and prevent an attacker from gaining access to all of your project, it is recommended to not use the default Compute Engine service account. Instead, you should create a new service account and assigning only the permissions needed by your instance.
  - Create GCP Custom Roles table {AEC} {Data} +8
  - Create GCP Folders table {AEC} {Data} +8
  - Create GCP Role Bindings table {AEC} {Data} +6
  - Create GCP Users table {AEC} {Data} +6
- GCP Key Management Report @samantha.wabi {AEC}
